## SIT ACM Student Chapter (SASC) - Open Source Projects

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the SIT ACM Student Chapter (SASC)! 

SASC is a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIT). We are a group of passionate computer science students dedicated to:

* Fostering a vibrant community for students interested in computing technologies.
* Providing opportunities for learning, collaboration, and professional development.
* Contributing to open-source projects and giving back to the developer community.

This repository serves as a hub for our open-source software projects. Here, you'll find innovative tools, helpful scripts, and interesting experiments developed by SASC members.

**What We Offer:**

* **Student-driven Projects:** Our projects reflect the diverse interests and talents of SIT's computer science students.
* **Real-world Skills Development:** We contribute to open-source to gain practical experience in software development, version control, and collaboration.
* **Open Collaboration:** We welcome contributions from the wider developer community. Feel free to fork our repositories, report issues, and suggest improvements!
